;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library implements a special Beamer back-end to export an Org
;; buffer to a lecture series. It is derived from the Beamer backend
;; which is derived from the LaTeX one.

;;; Code:

(require 'ox-beamer)

;; Create special LaTeX beamer lecture class It uses format-spec templates for
;; the expansion of %h handout and %l lecture label within the
;; org-beamer-lecture-template function. Appendix is redefined because using
;; lectures only the first \appendix is respected.

narrowed part.

If a region is active, export that region.

A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
asynchronously.  The resulting file should be accessible through
the `org-export-stack' interface.

When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
at point, extracting information from the headline properties
first.

When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
contents of hidden elements.

When optional argument BODY-ONLY is non-nil, only write code
between \"\\begin{document}\" and \"\\end{document}\".

EXT-PLIST, when provided, is a property list with external
parameters overriding Org default settings, but still inferior to
file-local settings.
